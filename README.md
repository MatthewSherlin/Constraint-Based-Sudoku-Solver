# ConstraintBasedSudokuSolver

Final Project for KSU CS-44201

Abstract:

Our AI project will focus on an AI solving a game of Sudoku. 
The purpose of our project is to show what we have learned about Constraint-based solution AIâ€™s. 
In our project we will use C# as the programming language for the brains of the AI. 
To show our data visually we will use Unity which is also C# based but allows us to make a more visually appealing UI. 
At the end of our project we will have an AI built in C# that solves a Sudoku game in the most efficient way as well as the ability to see any data it collects.
